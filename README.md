This will eventually be a multi-system emulator. Probably not for awhile. It will be slow for even longer. Likely forever. At least there's Inline::C. ¯\(°_o)/¯

The main reason I started this project was because I saw [this](http://www.ubernes.com/nesscreensaver.html) and thought it was the bee's knees.

Currently there is most of a 6502 simulator + monitor, along with test suite. It would not surprise me if it's completely broken.

Enjoy.
